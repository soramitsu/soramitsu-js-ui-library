# Testing

## Cypress

Cypress is configured and 2 simple tests with image snapshots are written.

## Jest

It is strange, but `vue-jest` transformer is still in alpha state of development and I haven't found a way to configure it without a great complexity.

One of the problems is that apparently, it requires `ts-jest` and `babel`. Shortly... idk how to configure it now in a clear way.
