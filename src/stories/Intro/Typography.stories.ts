                   Hyperledger Iroha is a straightforward DLT, inspired by Japanese Kaizen principle â€” eliminate excessiveness (muri). Iroha has essential functionality for your asset and identity management needs, at the same time being an efficient and trustworthy byzantine fault-tolerant tool for your enterprise needs.

                   We were hired to build Polkaswap, a decentralized exchange for the Polkadot ecosystem, capable of competing with traditional centralized exchanges. Based on Hyperledger Iroha v2, it will bridge to the Kusama and Polkadot networks, allowing users to swap between Substrate tokens. Polkaswap will provide a framework that allows us to connect many blockchains using bridges and become an exchange to connect Polkadot participants and other blockchains in the effective trading of assets.
